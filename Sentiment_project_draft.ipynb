    "### Research Questions: \n",
    "#### 1. How does public sentiment evolve over the course of a natural disaster and its recovery? What emotions are most commonly expressed by affected communities in the aftermath of a disaster ? (Timeline & Change in Sentiments on Social Media) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Are there significant differences in sentiment based on location or disaster type like a Fire vs Hurricane vs Earthquake in just USA (scoped to this for english speaking focus + similar policies across nation) Scope the severity of the disaster re: losses/damages roughly the same? We will look a these data sets in more detail and then decide if we want to broaden the scope to compare between types \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data: \n",
    "#### 1. Crisis NLP has data from wildfires including annotated tweets from 2018 California Wildfires (we can select a few events here? – need to check if the information is all in english for international events) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Twitter Sentiment Dataset has dataset of around 50,000 disaster related tweets with sentiment polarity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Hurricane Laura (2020) has a publicly available Twitter dataset with over 1 million tweets regarding the disaster. It was collected with a Twitter API and includes raw tweet JSON data. Each tweet includes text, timestamp, and available geolocation/ place tags.\n",
